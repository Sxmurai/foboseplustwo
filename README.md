# foboseplustwo
A continuation of Phobos, named Fobose+2

Just in case one of the Wurst+2 devs comes after me, the +2 at the end is a joke in reference to Wurst+2, the name Fobose is taken inspiration from the default AutoGG message Phobos had "haha <player> is noob fobus on tope"

---

## Why?

1. Phobos is pretty laggy for some reason, I don't know if it's my shitty PC but I've never seen a client lag up my game like Phobos does, I only have this issue with 1.9.0 Phobos aswell.
2. I've been wanting to edit alot of modules because they've caused me trouble in the past and I'd like to have a few features that I wish were in Phobos originally.
3. I'm fucking bored

## What does it have that regular Phobos does not?

Well, I'm in the process of adding and improving things, but here's what I've done so far:

- Updated to ForgeGradle 3.+
- Added Baritone
- Removed alot of bloat modules that almost nobody uses
- Removed alot of bloat Mixins and Managers that weren't in use or didn't serve an actual purpose
- More things coming soon:tm:

## Where did you get the original decompilatioon of Phobos?
